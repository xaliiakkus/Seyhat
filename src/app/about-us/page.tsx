                  TSG has roots in Bodrum, the tourism pearl of Turkey. Prior to
                  establishing ourselves as a dedicated tourism company, we
                  worked as group leaders from 1990 to 2005. In 2005, our love
                  for travel blossomed as we began hosting numerous guests at
                  the Bodrum Kalender Hotel. Next TravelShop Turkey was founded
                  on Valentine&#39;s Day in 2006. TSG experienced rapid growth,
                  leading us to relocate to Istanbul in 2009. Our services
                  expanded in line with this growth, encompassing Congress
                  tourism, MICE, weddings, a diverse array of Turkey-related
                  categories, and even Formula 1.

                  In 2015, we began offering Anzac Tours, which culminated in a
                  special cruise in 2018, serving 3,500 passengers. Starting
                  from Sydney and ending in Brisbane, the Anzac-inspired tour
                  included stops in Egypt, Gallipoli, Canakkale for the Dawn
                  Service, and Istanbul. The meticulously planned itinerary
                  offered customized arrival hours, sightseeing locations, and
                  continuous shuttle services. The success of it led us to
                  future high-participation organizations With a deep
                  understanding of the importance of connectivity and a wide
                  network, TSG launched Workshop TravelShop in 2016. Since then,
                  we have organized over 27+ international fairs worldwide,
                  bringing together experts.

                  for us. It is some how to explore the univers we live in, to
                  set up and raise ties with the people we never know and to
                  enrich with the new cultures, beliefs and way of breaths. The
                  aim that we are working to achieve is to make this possible
                  via bringing people together with the tours to all around the
                  world. So procuring new destinations, and flexible tours for
                  every interest as well as make arrange them luxury or
